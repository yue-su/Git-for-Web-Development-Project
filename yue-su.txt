Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
       A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
       An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.         

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
       An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
       By using max-width or min-width.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
       Block-level: <div>, <nav>, <section>
       inline-level: <a>, <img>, <span>
        
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
       The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
       By default, the box model dose not include padding and border in an element's total width and height.
       The "fix" of this issue is to set box-sizing property to border-box, which allow us to include the padding and border in an element's total width and height.

       * { box-sizing: border-box;}
